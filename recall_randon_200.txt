Refrigerate the uncooked egg contents immediately and use within two to four days. You can freeze the contents for up to 4 months. If you hard-boil eggs:   Cook eggs thoroughly in boiling water.   Cool eggs completely by immersing in cold tap water, and make sure they are kept cold before and after they are dyed.   Use a non-toxic colouring dye to decorate eggs.   Decorated eggs that have been left out for longer than two hours are not safe to eat and should be thrown away after Easter. If you\u2019re having an Easter egg hunt, carefully consider where you hide your eggs. Avoid areas where the eggs might come into contact with pets, wild animals, birds, insects or chemicals. Chocolate eggs: For those who prefer the sweeter taste of chocolate, here are a few things to keep in mind:   Although chocolate is not usually associated with foodborne illness, it is best eaten within one year of production. Check for the \u201cbest before\u201d date.   If you have food allergy concerns, be sure to read the label carefully for the presence of allergens such as peanuts or other nuts.   The white or grey film that develops on chocolate isn\u2019t a sign that it has gone bad. When the fats in chocolate separate from the cocoa mass, it results in something called \u201cfat bloom,\u201d which may alter the chocolate\u2019s taste or texture slightly, but is perfectly safe to eat.   Remember, don\u2019t overdo it! Most chocolate is high in sugar and fat and is best consumed in moderation.", "more_information": "   Eggs (General facts on preparing and cooking eggs safely)", "media_enquiries": "Health Canada (613) 957-2983", "public_enquiries": "(613) 957-2991 1-866 225-0709", "id_numbers": "Identification number: RA-52757"}, "product_details": {}, "image_details": {}}, {"basic_details": {"Issue": "Important Safety Information, Allergy Information", "Audience": "General Public, Healthcare Professionals", "Category": "Allergen - Milk, Natural health products", "Alert type": "Advisory", "Department": "Health Canada", "url": "http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2011/13577a-eng.php", "recallId": "RA-110004839", "title": "\n Exact\u2122 Multi Greens Powder and Capsules Recalled as They May Pose Serious Health Risks to Canadians with Milk Allergies", "start_date": 1296604800, "date_published": 1296604800}, "panel_details": {"cms_issue_problem": "Exact\u2122 Multi Greens Powder and Exact\u2122 Multi Greens Capsule are being voluntarily recalled by Pharmetics Inc. because of an allergy risk to people with milk sensitivities.

With the renewed popularity of seasonal, local eating and the desire to prepare healthy foods at home, many Canadians are looking to home canning (also known as home bottling) to preserve food for later use. However, if home canned foods are not properly prepared, they can cause serious illness such as botulism. If you are home canning or bottling your own foods (such as jams, pickles, soups and sauces), the following steps will help to reduce the risk of contamination or growth from Clostridium botulinum:   Clean and sanitize your hands, all work surfaces, utensils, and equipment and keep them clean during all stages of the canning process.  \u00a0   Use a pressure canner which is a large pressure vessel optimized for canning. A pressure canner is not the same as a pressure cooker. Strictly follow the manufacturer's instructions for canning or bottling foods considered to be low-acid, such as seafood, meats, vegetables and sauces. These low-acid foods must be processed in a pressure canner to destroy any Clostridium botulinum spores that might be present.  \u00a0   High-acid foods such as fruit, pickles, sauerkraut, jams, jellies, marmalades and fruit butters will not support the growth of Clostridium botulinum and can be safely processed in a boiling water canner.  \u00a0   Tomatoes are borderline high-acid food and require an acid, such as lemon juice or vinegar, to be added for safer canning.  \u00a0   When following currently tested recipes, do not substitute ingredients, amounts or the jar size that is in the recipe because this can cause the time or pressure needed during pressure canning or boiling water canning to change. This can lead to bacteria remaining in the food. Always follow recommended recipes and processes to the recommended temperature, time and pressure.  \u00a0   The jar lid should be firmly sealed and concave (curved slightly inwards). Nothing should have leaked from the jar, no unnatural odours should be detected, and no liquid should spurt out when the jar is opened.  \u00a0   Label your home-canned food, including the date it was canned. For best quality, use within one year from the date they were made.  \u00a0   Be sure to store your home-canned food in a cool, dry place.  \u00a0   If you are buying or are gifted home canned products, ask if they have followed proper safety steps. Always remember: never eat canned foods if you suspect the item has been tampered with, if the closure/seal has been broken, or if the container is swollen or leaking. When in doubt, throw it out! Botulism is a serious illness that can result from eating improperly prepared canned or bottled foods. Botulism is caused by a bacterium - called Clostridium botulinum - that naturally produces toxins as part of its normal life cycle. The toxin that causes botulism is colourless, odourless, tasteless and invisible to the naked eye and is not necessarily destroyed by cooking, so preventing the toxin from forming is essential. Symptoms of botulism range from nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, headache, double vision and dryness in the throat and nose, to respiratory failure, paralysis and, in some cases, death. The onset of symptoms is generally from 12\u00a0to 36\u00a0hours after ingesting the toxin. Recovery can take several weeks to months. It is estimated that there are approximately 11\u00a0million cases of food-related illnesses of all types in Canada every year. Many of these illnesses could be prevented by following proper food handling and preparation techniques.", "more_information": "For more information on food safety tips for home canning and bottling, please visit:   Botulism (Clostridium botulinum)   Home canning safety   Home canning and bottling of seafood - Health Canada   Partnership for Consumer Food Safety Education's Be Food Safe Canada Campaign", "media_enquiries": "Health Canada 613-957-2983", "public_enquiries": "613-957-2991 1-866 225-0709", "id_numbers": "Identification number: RA-110004623"}, "product_details": {}, "image_details": {}}, {"basic_details": {"Category": "Allergen - Egg, Allergen - Milk, Allergen - Wheat", "Alert type": "Recall", "Department": "Canadian Food Inspection Agency", "Hazard classification": "Class 3", "Alert sub-type": "Food Recall Warning (Allergen)", "Recalling firm": "Country Crocus Bakeshop", "Distribution": "Manitoba", "Extent of the product distribution": "Retail", "url": "http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/inspection/2014/40305r-eng.php", "recallId": "1403793798803", "title": "Country Crocus Bakeshop brand bread products recalled due to undeclared eggs, milk and wheat", "start_date": 1403740800, "date_published": -62169984000}, "panel_details": {"more_information": "For more information, consumers and industry can contact the CFIA by filling out the online feedback form.", "media_enquiries": "CFIA Media Relations613-773-6600", "id_numbers": "CFIA reference number: 8982"}, "product_details": {"product_1": {"Brand name": "Country Crocus Bakeshop", "Common name": "White Hotdog", "Size": "12 count", "Code(s) on product": "All codes where eggs, milk and wheat are not declared in the list of ingredients.", "UPC": "None"}, "product_2": {"Brand name": "Country Crocus Bakeshop", "Common name": "White Soft Bun", "Size": "12 count", "Code(s) on product": "All codes where eggs, milk and wheat are not declared in the list of ingredients.", "UPC": "None"}, "product_3": {"Brand name": "Country Crocus Bakeshop", "Common name": "White Hamburger", "Size": "12 count", "Code(s) on product": "All codes where eggs, milk and wheat are not declared in the list of ingredients.", "UPC": "None"}, "product_4": {"Brand name": "Country Crocus Bakeshop", "Common name": "White Sandwich", "Size": "950 g", "Code(s) on product": "All codes where eggs, milk and wheat are not declared in the list of ingredients.", "UPC": "None"}, "product_5": {"Brand name": "Country Crocus Bakeshop", "Common name": "White Bread", "Size": "475 g", "Code(s) on product": "All codes where eggs, milk and wheat are not declared in the list of ingredients.", "UPC": "None"}}, "image_details": {}}, {"basic_details": {"Issue": "Food Safety", "Audience": "General Public", "Category": "Other", "Alert type": "Information Update", "Department": "Health Canada", "url": "http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2013/25979a-eng.php", "recallId": "RA-25979", "title": "\n Reminding Canadians How to Safely Consume Leftovers", "start_date": 1363046400, "date_published": 1363046400}, "panel_details": {"cms_issue_problem": "Many Canadians enjoy eating leftovers from holiday festivities, family gatherings or from dining out.

Handling leftovers   Before and after handling leftovers, wash your hands as well as all utensils, dishes and work surfaces with hot soapy water.   Keep foods out of the danger zone, between 4\u00b0C (40\u00b0F) and 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F) to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria.   Throw away any cooked food left in the danger zone for more than two hours.   Never rely on your nose, eyes or taste buds to judge the safety of food. You cannot tell if food is contaminated by its look, smell or taste. When in doubt, throw it out! Cooling leftovers   Refrigerate all hot leftovers promptly in uncovered, shallow containers so they cool quickly.   Very hot items can first be cooled at room temperature. Refrigerate once steaming stops.   Leave the lid off or wrap loosely until the food is cooled to refrigeration temperature.   Avoid overstocking the refrigerator to allow cool air to circulate freely. Storing leftovers   Always use a clean container to hold leftovers, or wrap leftovers in leak-proof plastic bags to prevent cross-contamination. Keep different types of leftovers separate.   Eat refrigerated leftovers within 2 to 3 days, or freeze them for later use.   Date leftovers to help identify the contents and to ensure they are not stored too long. Defrosting leftovers   Thaw frozen leftovers in the refrigerator or in the microwave. Ensure food is properly sealed.   Use the defrost setting of your microwave and make sure leftovers are completely defrosted before reheating.   Consume or cook the leftovers immediately after they have thawed. Reheating leftovers   Reheat leftovers to a safe internal temperature of 74\u00b0C (165\u00b0F).   Use a digital food thermometer to check the temperature.

An illness can be difficult for any individual to deal with. Sometimes, when you are ill, your immune system is weakened by your condition or by the treatments you are receiving, which makes it harder for your body to fight off infections. Some examples of people who may have weakened immune systems include transplant patients and those with diabetes and\u00a0HIV, as well as individuals receiving chemotherapy for cancer. It is extremely important for people with weakened immune systems and their caregivers to follow food safety steps and also avoid eating certain foods to help lower the risk of foodborne illness. It's estimated that there are approximately 11\u00a0million cases of foodborne illnesses in Canada every year. Many of these illnesses could be prevented by following proper food handling and preparation techniques. To minimize the risks of foodborne illness, people with weakened immune systems and their caregivers should follow the four key steps to food safety: Cook. Clean. Chill. Separate. Caution   Those with weakened immune systems should also pay close attention to what they're eating. Some foods are at a higher risk for foodborne illness than others.         Make sure to cook hot dogs and deli meats until they are steaming hot before eating them       Don't eat raw or undercooked meat, poultry and seafood       Avoid refrigerated smoked fish or seafood       Avoid unpasteurized juice, cider and milk       Avoid soft and semi-soft cheeses made from raw or unpasteurized milk       Avoid refrigerated p\u00e2t\u00e9s and meat spreads       Avoid uncooked foods made from raw or unpasteurized eggs    For more information on the four steps to food safety and food safety tips for those with weakened immune systems, please visit:   Government of Canada's Food Safety Tips for People with Weakened Immune Systems   It's Your Health on Food Safety for People with Weakened Immune Systems   Government of Canada's Food Safety website   Partnership for Consumer Food Safety Education's Be Food Safe Canada Campaign  \u00a0", "media_enquiries": "Health Canada 613-957-2983", "public_enquiries": "613-957-2991 1-866-225-0709", "id_numbers": "Identification number: RA-110004200"}, "product_details": {}, "image_details": {}}, {"basic_details": {"Category": "Allergen - Milk", "Alert type": "Recall", "Department": "Canadian Food Inspection Agency", "Hazard classification": "Class 2", "Alert sub-type": "Food Recall Warning (Allergen)", "Recalling firm": "Ecoideas Innovations <abbr title='Incorporated'>Inc.</abbr>", "Distribution": "Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec", "Extent of the product distribution": "Retail", "url": "http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/inspection/2013/36765r-eng.php", "recallId": "1384459674730", "title": "Ethnoscience brand Dark Chocolate GOJI Berries recalled due to undeclared milk", "start_date": 1384387200, "date_published": -62169984000}, "panel_details": {"details": "Ottawa, November 14, 2013 - Ecoideas Innovations Inc. is recalling Ethnoscience brand Dark Chocolate GOJI Berries from the marketplace because they contain milk which is not declared on the label.

For people with food allergies, sensitivities or intolerances, the best way to prevent an allergic reaction is to avoid the specific food or ingredient in the first place. When you have food allergies, it is especially important to read food labels.

As you head out to the grill, remember that eating undercooked meat or foods that have come into contact with raw meat can result in food poisoning (also known as foodborne illness) caused by bacteria such as E. coli, Salmonella and Campylobacter. Symptoms can include severe stomach cramps, vomiting, fever and diarrhea. It is estimated that approximately 1 in 8 people will get sick from foodborne illness every year in Canada. Many of these cases could be prevented by following proper food handling and preparation techniques.", "cms_who_what_consumer": "You can help lower your risk of foodborne illness by handling and cooking raw meat carefully. Here are some important safety tips to follow: Storing   Raw meat should always be stored in a refrigerator or cooler at 4\u00baC (40\u00baF) or below.   If you are storing raw meat in a cooler, make sure that it is packed with ice and that it stays out of direct sunlight. Avoid opening the cooler too often.   Ensure that packaged meats are well sealed and are placed at the bottom of your refrigerator or cooler, so their juices don\u2019t come in contact with other food products, thus avoiding cross-contamination. Cleaning   Remember to wash your hands, cutting boards, countertops, knives and other utensils carefully with soap and warm water before and after handling raw meat or other raw foods. This helps avoid cross-contamination and prevents the spread of foodborne illness. Grilling   Colour alone is not a reliable indicator that meat is safe to eat. Meat may turn brown before dangerous bacteria that may be present, are killed. Use a digital food thermometer to be sure your meat has reached a safe internal temperature.   To check the temperature of meat that you are cooking on the barbecue, take it off the grill and insert a digital food thermometer through the thickest part of the meat.   If you are cooking a beef hamburger, take the patty from the grill and insert a digital food thermometer through its side, all the way to the middle.   If you are cooking more than one patty, or several pieces of meat, be sure to check the temperature of each piece.   Use clean utensils and plates when removing cooked meats from the grill.   Remember to wash the thermometer in hot, soapy water between every temperature reading (including between every piece of meat or patty checked).   Always remember to keep hot food hot until it is ready to serve.   Follow this guide to make sure that the food you are cooking has reached a safe internal temperature.

The department has now reviewed the comments received and is publishing documents detailing some of the changes being made to the proposal as a result of the consultations. As a result of the over 140 comments received up until early December 2008 following the publication of the proposed regulatory amendment in Canada Gazette, Part I in July 2008, Health Canada has made several decisions and changes to its regulatory proposal to address concerns raised by stakeholders and Canadian consumers. These include:   The development of Canadian criteria for the establishment of new priority food allergens;   The decision to add mustard as a priority allergen in the regulations based on this criteria document;   The decision to not add onions and garlic to the list of priority allergens in the regulations based on this criteria document; and   The decision to remove the proposed exemptions of declaration for fining agents and wax coatings on the labels of pre-packaged food products. The department is now working on updating the regulatory proposal to reflect these decisions and other comments received during the consultations in order to move forward in the regulatory process. The goal is to have the updated regulations published in the Canada Gazette Part II in the spring of 2010. The current Food and Drug Regulations require that ingredients of food products be declared on the labels of most prepackaged foods. However, components of certain ingredients are exempted from declaration in the list of ingredients. While the Canadian Food Inspection Agency does have the ability to recall foods exempted from the labelling requirements if a health risk is identified with undeclared allergens, the strengthened labelling regulations will provide manufacturers with clear labelling rules for allergens to be followed in a systematic and consistent manner, aimed at reducing the number of food recalls and allergic reactions. It is estimated that up to six per cent of young children and three to four per cent of adults suffer from food allergies. Nearly one per cent of the population is affected by celiac disease, a serious sensitivity to gluten. Health Canada will continue to update Canadians on the progress of this file as the regulatory proposal moves forward. Please visit the Health Canada website for a summary of the consultation results, as well as information on how Health Canada will be addressing some of the most significant comments.", "more_information": " For more information on food allergies, please visit:   Health Canada's Food Allergy and Intolerances Page   Health Canada's Allergen Labelling Page   Health Canada's Celiac Disease Page", "media_enquiries": "Health Canada 613-957-2983", "public_enquiries": "613-957-2991 1-866-225-0709", "id_numbers": "Identification number: RA-110003019"}, "product_details": {}, "image_details": {}}, {"basic_details": {"Category": "Allergen -

However, many of the foods found at holiday parties, such as baked goods, eggnog, cider, seafood and turkey, can carry bacteria that cause illness. Health Canada would like to remind all Canadians of some basic steps they can take to help reduce the risk of foodborne illness during the holiday season.   Baked goods: Holiday cookies and squares are a special treat, but uncooked cookie dough, batters or frostings made with raw eggs can contain Salmonella bacteria. Always make sure your baked goods are cooked thoroughly and never lick the spoon or eat raw cookie dough when baking using raw eggs.   Eggnog: Store-bought eggnog is pasteurized to remove any dangerous bacteria before it is shipped for sale. If you're making eggnog at home using raw eggs, be sure to heat the egg and milk mixture to at least 71\u00b0 C (160\u00b0 F). Immediately after heating, refrigerate the eggnog in small, shallow containers to allow it to cool quickly. Or, use pasteurized egg and milk ingredients, which are available at many grocery stores.   Fruit juice and cider: When making punch or serving cider, check the product label to make sure the juice or cider has been pasteurized. Unpasteurized juice may contain bacteria like E.coli or Salmonella that may cause serious illness, especially in children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems. If it has not been pasteurized, you can make it safer by boiling the product before serving.   Oysters and seafood: Some people enjoy eating raw seafood, such as oysters and sushi, during their holiday festivities. However, raw or undercooked fish and seafood may contain bacteria, parasites or viruses, so special care is needed in their preparation and handling. Keep seafood like raw oysters or cold cooked shrimp rings refrigerated and serve them on ice to ensure they remain cold at holiday buffets. People who are more vulnerable to the risks of foodborne illness, such as older adults, pregnant women, young children and people with weakened immune systems, should avoid eating raw or undercooked fish and seafood.   Holiday Buffets: If you are serving food buffet-style, use warming trays, chafing dishes or crock pots to keep hot foods hot, and put serving trays on crushed ice to keep cold foods cold. Don't let food remain at room temperature for more than two hours or add new food to serving dishes already in use. Instead, use a clean platter or serving dish each time you re-stock the buffet.   Turkey and stuffing: If cooking a turkey for a holiday meal, use a digital food thermometer to make sure it is cooked properly. The temperature of the thickest part of the breast or thigh should be at least 85\u00b0 C (185\u00b0 F). To prevent potential cross-contamination, cook stuffing separately in its own oven dish or on the stove top. If you do stuff your turkey, stuff loosely just prior to roasting, and remove all stuffing immediately after cooking. Cook stuffing to a minimum internal temperature of 74\u00b0 C (165\u00b0 F), and refrigerate within two hours of cooking. It's estimated that there are approximately 11 million cases of food-related illnesses in Canada every year. Many of these illnesses could be prevented by following proper food handling and preparation techniques.
